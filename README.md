## tetris

Tetris is a fun game where you try to fit colorful blocks/tetrominoes together like puzzle pieces.
A tetrominoe is a geometric shape composed of 4 squares, connected orthogonally (orthogonally means connected through the edges not the corners).

Invented by the Soviet game designer Alexey Pajitnov, it consists of blocks/tetrominoes falling from the top
of the screen, and you have to move and turn them to make complete rows.
When a complete row is made, it disappears, and you get points.

These blocks/tetrominoes can only move left or right, and sometimes rotate them.
